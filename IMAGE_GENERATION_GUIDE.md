### Page 7 - Door Opens

The chamber is grand and awe-inspiring with golden light reflecting everywhere. Majestic, wonder-filled storybook illustration with dramatic lighting and sense of discovery.

### Page 10 - Crystal Mystery
**Filename:** `banana-page-10.png`
**Prompt:**

A mysterious treasure chest opening by itself with a dramatic "snap!" revealing not coins or crowns, but a mesmerizing black crystal that pulses with an otherworldly rhythm (thump-thump-thump). The torches around the chamber are fizzling out one by one, creating growing darkness. In the shadows, ethereal whispers curl around the group: "Welcome, travelers... I've been waiting." The crystal emanates a subtle dark energy. All animals look intrigued but slightly uncertain. Mysterious, cliffhanger atmosphere with dramatic lighting. Storybook art that's intriguing but not frightening.
